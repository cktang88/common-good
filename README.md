An app that makes donating to non-profits essentially one-click, instead of a long tiresome process. Focus on small donations ($!, $2, $5)?

** challenges: try not to store credit cards b/c then must be PCI complaint. Maybe use Stripe? But somehow need to not make users input their credit cards each time they want to donate.

** legal issues

** Google/FB OAuth for personal info storage/login?

** integrate Google Pay/ Apple Pay?
