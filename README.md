An app that makes donating to non-profits essentially one-click, instead of a long tiresome process. Focus on small donations ($!, $2, $5)?

** challenges: Use Stripe API? But somehow need to not make users input their credit cards each time they want to donate.

** legal issues

** Google/FB OAuth for personal info storage/login?

** integrate Google Pay/ Apple Pay?
  - or use Ethereum, blockchain tech somehow?
  - make it so that people can do tasks (eg. Amazon's mech turk, or lease their computing resource on idle device, or look at tiny ad) in order to donate to nonprofit?
